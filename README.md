# BB-8 animation

## The Assignment
 
This assignment was completed in a team of two computer engineering students for Computer Animation course at UBC (CPSC426) in Feb 2019. 

The task is to use the three.js and keyframes to develop and animate a scene that tells a very short animated story. Through this assignment we gained a detailed understanding of keyframing, spline-based motion interpolation, and spline-based object deformations. ​​​​​​​

## Dependencies

You will need Node.js to run it locally, so please install Node.js if you haven't done so yet. Node.js comes with a tool called NPM (Node Package Manager), which you can use to install HTTP server package.

## Run it Locally 

Node.js has a simple HTTP server package. To install:
```
npm install http-server -g
``` 

To run (from your local directory):
```
http-server . -p 8000
``` 

This will serve files from the current directory at localhost under port 8000, i.e in the address bar type:
```
http://localhost:8000/a2.html
```
